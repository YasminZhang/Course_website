## Overview
This course introduces the foundational concepts and algorithms of machine learning and deep learning. The goal of this course is to endow the student with a) a solid understanding of the foundational concepts of machine learning, and b) morden machine learning techniques such as deep learning. Topics to be covered include empirical risk minimization, PAC learning, Agnostic PAC learning, perceptron, linear regression, boosting, stochastic gradient descent, support vector machines, multi-layer perceptron, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, attention mechanism. Slides and homework assignments will be released on this website. Homework solutions will only be released on Bruinlearn.

## Prerequisites

## Academic Integrity Policy
Students are encouraged to read the [UCLA Student Conduct Code](https://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/Individual-Student-Code) for Academic Integrity. 

## Homework
There will be about 5 homework assignments during the semester as we cover the corresponding material. Homework consists of both mathematical derivation, algorithm analysis and programming. Homework is required to be written in Latex. Latex homework template can be found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/gspjpbqhbntv). The lowest homework score will be dropped for you.

Unless otherwise indicated, you may talk to other students about the homework problems but each student must hand in their own answers and write their own code in the programming part. You also must indicate on each homework with whom you collaborated and cite any other sources you use including Internet sites. Students cannot use old solution sets for this class or solution manual to the textbook under any circumstances.

Homework assignments will be submitted through Gradescope.

Please submit your homework on time. Homework is worth full credit before the due date. It is worth zero credit after the due date.

## Exam
There will be one in-class midterm on Oct 31.

## Quiz
There will be 6 in-class pop-up quiz for the purpose of reviewing the newly learned concepts. The quizzes are closed book and closed notes. No electronic aids or cheat sheets are allowed. We will drop the lowest quiz score for you.

## Project
Students are required to do a project in this class. The goal of the course project is to provide you an opportunity to either do machine learning research or solve a real-world problem using machine learning. 

The best outcome of the project is a manuscript that is publishable in major machine learning conferences (COLT, ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, AISTATS, UAI etc.) or journals (Journal of Machine Learning Research, Machine Learning).
